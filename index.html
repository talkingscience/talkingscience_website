        <h1>About</h1>
      </div>
      <p> This year's guest is <a target="_blank" href= "https://www.mpg.de/12309357/biologische-kybernetik-dayan" >Prof. Eve Marder</a> (Brandeis University).</p>

      <p>Prof. Peter Dayan's research bridges neuroscience, computational modelling and psychiatry. At this interface, he has advanced the understanding of reinforcement learning and decision-making processes in the brain, as well as the role of neuromodulators and neuronal dysfunction in psychiatric disorders. He is considered a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence and has long worked at the interface between natural and artificial systems for learning and choice.</p>

	     <p>He studied mathematics at Cambridge University and received his doctorate from the University of Edinburgh. After postdoctoral research at the Salk Institute and the University of Toronto he moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston as assistant professor in 1995. In 1998, he moved to London to help co-found the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, whose Director he was from 2002 to 2017 and which became one of the best-known institutions for research in theoretical neuroscience. He was also Deputy Director of the Max Planck/UCL Center for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research. In 2018, he moved to Tübingen to become a Director at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics.

In 2017, he was awarded the Brain Prize from the European Brain Research Foundation and received an Alexander von Humboldt Professorship, Germany’s most highly endowed research prize. In 2018, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of the United Kingdom and in 2019, he became a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).

</p>

      <p>The Talking Science program consists of two talks, open to the public, and two round table discussions on science and career, open to Munich neuroscience students. Additionally, Munich neuroscience students will have the opportunity to sign up for individual one-on-one meetings with Professor Dayan.

        <dd><b>Julius Bernstein Lecture: <i>Replay and preplay in planning in humans</i></b>

        <br>This lecture is open to the general scientific community and is intended as an introduction into the Talking Science program.<br>
		<br><p>"Animals and humans replay neural patterns encoding trajectories through
their environment, both whilst they solve decision-making tasks and
during rest. Under a common assumption that we build models of the
world and recognize and plan actions using those models, such
intrinsically generated patterns are ideal for various forms of model
inversion, giving us access to fast and effective methods for sensory
processing and decision-making.  I will discuss recent investigations
using magnetoencephalography to detect replay in human subjects as they
perform decision-making tasks. In a simple choice task, we found
evidence for various forms of replay, which differed between subjects
who flexibly adjusted their choices to changes in temporal, spatial and
reward structure and those who were slower to adapt to change.  The
former group predominantly replayed comparatively less good
trajectories during task performance, and subsequently avoided these
inefficient choices. The latter replayed comparatively preferred, but
suboptimal, trajectories during rest periods between task epochs. We
suggest that online and offline replay both contribute to planning, but
each are associated with distinct model-based and model-free decision
strategies.</p>

Antonov and Chris Gagne."</p><br><br></dd>

        <dd><b>Discussion Forum: Behavioral Modelling from the beginning</b>
	    <br>This discussion is open to the general scientific community.<br>
		
				<br><p>"Much work has been devoted to formal characterizations of the ways that
humans and other animals make decisions in mostly stable,
near-asymptotic, regimes in behavioural tasks. Although this has been
highly revealing, it hides aspects of learning that happen on the way
to this asymptote. I will discuss three attempts that we have been
making to use parametric and non-parametric models to capture more of
the course of learning: in a spatial alternation task for rats, the
International Brain Lab task for mice, and an alternating serial
reaction time task for humans. Many incompletely addressed challenges
arise - for instance separating individual differences in outcomes into
differences between models, differences between parameters within a
model, or path dependence from stochasticity in early choices and
outcomes."</p><br><br></dd>
